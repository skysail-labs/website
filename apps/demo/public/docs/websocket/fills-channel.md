# Fills Channel

:::info TL;DR
`/ws/fills` streams a **fill memo** per continuation fill: the data you need to
recover the change note a partial fill produced. You verify each memo against
your own keys before storing it, so a misbehaving engine cannot slip you a note you
do not control. The stream is per-account.
:::

## Why a separate fills stream

When an order partially fills, the remainder is re-locked into a new **change
note** that you own. To spend that note later you need its secret opening: the
anchor (`inner_hash`) the engine consumed and the resulting commitment. The fills
channel delivers exactly that, per fill, so your local note store stays complete
without you scanning the chain for it.

The [Orders Channel](./orders-channel) tells you *that* an order filled and how
much. The fills channel tells you *which note* the change went into so you can
spend it.

## Connect

```text
wss://<gateway-host>/ws/fills?token=<access_token>
```

Self-authenticating with the bearer token as `?token=`. Per-account: you only
receive memos for orders you placed.

## Memo shape

```json
{
  "seq": 5,
  "order_id": "aa00000000000000000000000000000001",
  "anchor_index": 0,
  "change_amount": 7000000,
  "change_note_commitment": "…",
  "mint": "…",
  "inner_hash": "…"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `seq` | integer | Per-connection monotonic sequence, starting at 1. A gap means missed memos, so re-run the backfill. |
| `order_id` | string | The 16-byte order id, hex. |
| `anchor_index` | integer | Which continuation anchor the engine consumed for this fill. |
| `change_amount` | integer | The value of the change note. |
| `change_note_commitment` | string | 32-byte hex commitment of the change note. |
| `mint` | string | 32-byte hex mint of the change note. |
| `inner_hash` | string | 32-byte hex inner hash of the change note (the anchor that was consumed). |

## Verify before you store

A fill memo is **untrusted input**. Verify it before adding the change note to
your store. The SDK performs two checks:

1. **Anchor binding.** The memo's `inner_hash` must equal the anchor your own
   client deterministically derived for `(order_id, anchor_index)`. An engine
   that substituted a different inner hash, so it could later forge a nullifier
   it controls, is caught here.
2. **Commitment binding.** Recomputing the note commitment from the memo's fields
   must equal the reported `change_note_commitment`.

Only a memo that passes both becomes a stored, spendable change note. This is the
guard that keeps a misbehaving engine from substituting a note you do not own.

## Durability and gap recovery

The live memo is the low-latency path, not the durable one. The permanent source
of a change note is **on-chain**: when you place an order with a `viewing_pubkey`
(see [Place Order](../orders/place-order)), the engine encrypts each change amount
to that key and writes the ciphertext into the settlement on Solana. That
ciphertext is permanent and survives an engine redeploy, so the change note is
recoverable long after the live memo is gone.

Recovery is therefore "backfill then tail":

1. **Backfill from the chain.** For fills that settled before your socket opened,
   or while it was down, the SDK reads the on-chain ciphertext for your settled
   orders, decrypts each change amount with your viewing key, and **self-verifies**
   it by recomputing the change-note commitment. No trust in the engine is needed.
2. **Tail the live stream.** Open `/ws/fills` for low-latency memos of new fills.

Because the note store is keyed by commitment, a note seen in both the backfill
and the live stream is simply de-duplicated, so a dropped connection never loses a
fill. If a slow consumer lags past the per-account buffer, the server closes with
code **1011**; on 1011, re-run the backfill from the chain and reopen.

:::note The chain is the source of truth
The live memo exists for latency. Even if you never connect the fills socket, any
change note from an order placed with a `viewing_pubkey` is fully recoverable from
on-chain data plus your keys. An order placed **without** a viewing key relies only
on the live memo, so connect the socket if you omit it.

## Example

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(`${WSS}/ws/fills?token=${TOKEN}`);

ws.onmessage = async (e) => {
  const memo = JSON.parse(e.data);
  // The SDK verifies (anchor + commitment binding) then stores the change note.
  await sdk.receiveFillMemo(memo);   // throws on a memo that fails verification
};

ws.onclose = (e) => {
  if (e.code === 1011) backfillThenReopen();
};
```
