# Order Compatibility

:::info
Not every combination of type, time-in-force, and execution attribute makes
sense. This page is the validity matrix - read it before assembling an order
programmatically.
:::

## Type × Time in Force

| Type | GTC / GTT (rests) | IOC | FOK |
|---|---|---|---|
| `limit` | Yes - the standard resting order | - (use `ioc`) | - (use `fok`) |
| `ioc` | No - IOC never rests | Yes | - |
| `fok` | No - FOK never rests | - | Yes |

Time-in-force on Darknyx is carried by the order type plus `expiry_slot`: a resting
order is a `limit` with an expiry; an immediate order is `ioc` or `fok`. See
[Time in Force](./time-in-force).

## Type × Execution Attributes

| Type | `min_fill_size` | All-or-none (`min_fill_size = amount`) |
|---|---|---|
| `limit` | Yes | Yes - rests until a batch can fill it whole |
| `ioc` | Yes | Yes - takes whole-or-nothing immediately, residual cancels |
| `fok` | Redundant | Implicit - FOK is already whole-or-nothing |

## Type × Price field

| Type | `price_limit` |
|---|---|
| `limit` | Required - the worst acceptable price. |
| `ioc` (bid) | Required - the price cap (a "market bid" is an IOC with a cap). |
| `ioc` (ask) | Optional - `0` accepts any clearing price (a "market ask"). |
| `fok` | Required - the whole order must clear at this price or better. |

A bid always needs a positive `price_limit` (a buy at price zero is meaningless,
and the collateral must cover the worst case). An ask may set `price_limit = 0` to
sell into any clearing price.

## Modifiability

| Action | Supported |
|---|---|
| Cancel a resting order | Yes - [Cancel Order](../orders/cancel-order) |
| Modify a resting order (atomic cancel + replace) | Yes - [Modify Order](../orders/modify-order) |
| Top up a resting order's anchor pool | Yes - [Anchor Top-Up](../orders/anchor-topup) |

IOC and FOK orders do not rest, so there is nothing to cancel, modify, or top up
after they execute.

## Quick validity examples

| Intent | Type | Price | `min_fill_size` | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resting bid at a price (GTC) | `limit` | required | `0` | far |
| Resting bid, good for 10 min (GTT) | `limit` | required | `0` | deadline slot |
| Resting bid, fill-whole-or-wait (AON) | `limit` | required | `= amount` | far |
| Cross now up to a cap (market bid) | `ioc` | cap | `0` | n/a |
| Sell now at any price (market ask) | `ioc` | `0` | `0` | n/a |
| Immediate, whole, or nothing | `fok` | required | n/a | n/a |
